description: Overview of the Community Bot Twitch chat bot.
---

The Twitch bot is built with [@twurple/chat](https://twurple.js.org/) v7 and provides a full-featured chat bot experience with database-driven commands, viewer queues, and stream status tracking.

## Features

- **Database-driven commands** with variables, cooldowns, access levels, and regex triggers
- **19 built-in commands** including shoutout, quote, counter, followage, moderation, and queue management
- **Quotes** — cross-platform quote system shared with Discord
- **Named counters** — track deaths, wins, or any numeric value with `{counter}` variable support
- **Recurring timers** — scheduled chat messages at configurable intervals
- **Spam filters** — caps, links, symbols, emotes, repetition, and banned word filtering
- **Moderation commands** — permit, nuke, vanish, and clip
- **AI-enhanced shoutouts** — personalized shoutout messages via Google Gemini
- **Viewer queue system** for managing viewer participation
- **Stream status tracking** with online/offline command filtering
- **Auto-reloading** commands and regulars every 5 minutes (with instant EventBus updates from the web dashboard)
- **Device Code Flow** authentication for Twitch OAuth
- **Express API** for external integrations

## Architecture

The bot runs as a single Node.js process with:

1. **Twurple chat client** — Connects to Twitch IRC
2. **Command pipeline** — Three-phase message processing (built-in, DB prefix, DB regex)
3. **Express API** — HTTP server on port 3737 (configurable) with [comprehensive health check](/docs/development/health-checks) endpoint
4. **Cron scheduler** — Periodic reloading of commands and regulars from the database

## Entry Point

The bot starts from `apps/twitch/src/app.ts`, which:

1. Connects to PostgreSQL via Prisma
2. Starts the API server
3. Loads command cache and regulars from the database
4. Creates Twitch auth provider and validates tokens
5. Starts stream status polling
6. Schedules periodic command/regular reloads
7. Creates the chat client, registers event handlers, and connects
