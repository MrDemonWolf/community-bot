title: Importing Commands
description: Import pre-built commands from the included commands.json into the database.
---

The Twitch bot ships with **50+ pre-built commands** in `apps/twitch/prisma/commands.json`. These include community links, social media shoutouts, stream info commands, and more.

## Quick Import

Make sure your database is running and the schema is pushed, then:

```bash
cd apps/twitch
pnpm db:import
```

This reads `prisma/commands.json` and upserts every command into the `TwitchChatCommand` table. Existing commands with the same name are updated; new ones are created.

## Import from a Custom File

You can also import from any JSON file:

```bash
pnpm db:import /path/to/your/commands.json
```

## JSON Format

The file should contain an array of command objects:

```json
[
  {
    "name": "github",
    "enabled": true,
    "response": "Check out the code at https://github.com/mrdemonwolf",
    "responseType": "SAY",
    "globalCooldown": 5,
    "userCooldown": 15,
    "accessLevel": "EVERYONE",
    "streamStatus": "BOTH",
    "hidden": false,
    "aliases": ["gh", "repo"],
    "keywords": []
  }
]
```
