The giveaway system lets moderators run keyword-based giveaways in chat. Viewers enter by typing the keyword, and a winner is randomly drawn.

## Commands

### Moderator Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `!giveaway start <keyword> [title]` | Start a new giveaway with the given keyword |
| `!giveaway draw` | Draw a random winner from entries |
| `!giveaway reroll` | Pick a new winner (reroll) |
| `!giveaway end` | End the active giveaway |

### Viewer Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `!giveaway count` | Show the number of entries |

## How It Works

- A moderator starts a giveaway with `!giveaway start <keyword>`.
- Viewers enter by typing the keyword in chat (e.g., `!enter`).
- Each viewer can only enter once per giveaway.
- Starting a new giveaway automatically ends any previous active giveaway.
- The `!giveaway draw` command randomly selects a winner from all entries.
- Use `!giveaway reroll` to pick a different winner if needed.

## Dashboard Management

Giveaways can also be managed from the web dashboard at `/dashboard/giveaways`. The dashboard supports:

- Creating new giveaways
- Drawing and rerolling winners
- Viewing entry counts
- Browsing giveaway history

## Aliases

The `!ga` alias is available as a shorthand for `!giveaway`.
