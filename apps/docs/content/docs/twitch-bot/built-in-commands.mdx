description: Hardcoded chat commands available in the Twitch bot.
---

Built-in commands are checked first in the command pipeline (Phase 1) and always run regardless of database state.

## Available Commands

### `!ping`
Returns "Pong!" to confirm the bot is responsive.

### `!uptime`
Shows how long the stream has been live, or indicates the stream is offline.

### `!accountage`
Shows how old the user's Twitch account is.

### `!bot mute` / `!bot unmute`
Mutes or unmutes the bot. When muted, only `!bot unmute` is processed. Requires moderator or broadcaster access.

### `!filesay <filename>`
Reads a text file and sends its contents to chat. Requires broadcaster access.

### `!command add|edit|remove|list`
Manages database commands from chat. See [Database Commands](/docs/twitch-bot/database-commands) for details.

**Usage:**
- `!command add <name> <response>` — Create a new command
- `!command edit <name> <response>` — Update an existing command's response
- `!command remove <name>` — Delete a command
- `!command list` — List all database commands

Requires moderator or broadcaster access.

### `!reloadcommands`
Immediately reloads commands and regulars from the database without waiting for the 60-second cron cycle. Requires moderator or broadcaster access.

### `!commands`
Sends a link to the public commands page. Requires the `WEB_URL` environment variable to be set on the Twitch bot. If not configured, the bot replies with a "not configured" message.
