title: Built-in Commands
description: Hardcoded chat commands available in the Twitch bot.
---

Built-in commands are checked first in the command pipeline (Phase 1) and always run regardless of database state.

Built-in commands can be enabled/disabled and their access levels changed per-channel from the web dashboard's Commands page.

## Available Commands

### `!ping`
Returns "Pong!" to confirm the bot is responsive.

### `!uptime`
Shows how long the stream has been live, or indicates the stream is offline.

### `!accountage [username]`
Shows how old a Twitch account is. You can check another user's account by passing their username as an argument.

**Aliases:** `!accage`, `!created`

### `!bot mute` / `!bot unmute`
Mutes or unmutes the bot. When muted, only `!bot unmute` is processed. Requires moderator or broadcaster access.

### `!filesay <url>`
Fetches a text file from a URL and sends each line to chat with a 1-second delay between lines. Only HTTPS and HTTP URLs are accepted. Requires broadcaster access.

### `!command`
Manages database commands from chat. See [Database Commands](/docs/twitch-bot/database-commands) for details.

**Subcommands:**
- `!command add <name> <response>` — Create a new command
- `!command edit <name> <response>` — Update an existing command's response
- `!command remove <name>` — Delete a command (also accepts `!command delete`)
- `!command show <name>` — Show a command's settings (response type, access level, cooldowns, aliases, etc.)
- `!command options <name> <flags...>` — Modify command settings with flags

**Option flags for `!command options`:**
- `-cd <seconds>` — Set global cooldown
- `-usercd <seconds>` — Set per-user cooldown
- `-level <level>` — Set access level (everyone, subscriber, regular, vip, moderator, broadcaster)
- `-type <type>` — Set response type (say, mention, reply)
- `-enable` / `-disable` — Enable or disable the command
- `-hidden` / `-visible` — Toggle hidden status
- `-stream <status>` — Set stream status filter (online, offline, both)
- `-limituser <username>` — Restrict to a specific user (`clear` to remove)
- `-alias add <name>` / `-alias remove <name>` — Add or remove an alias

Requires moderator or broadcaster access.

### `!reloadcommands`
Immediately reloads commands and regulars from the database without waiting for the 5-minute cron cycle. Requires moderator or broadcaster access.

### `!commands`
Sends a link to the public commands page. Requires the `WEB_URL` environment variable to be set on the Twitch bot. If not configured, the bot replies with a "not configured" message.

See [Public Pages](/docs/web-dashboard/public-pages) for what viewers see. Set `WEB_URL` in [Environment Variables](/docs/getting-started/environment-variables).
