description: Twitch-native poll management via chat commands.
---

The poll system lets moderators create and manage Twitch-native polls directly from chat. Polls use the Twitch Helix API, so they appear as native Twitch polls in the viewer's chat.

## Commands

### Moderator Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `!poll create "Question" "Option 1" "Option 2" [duration]` | Create a new poll |
| `!poll end` | End the currently active poll |
| `!poll results` | Show the latest poll results |

## How It Works

- Use quoted strings for the question and each option (minimum 2, maximum 5 options).
- The optional duration is specified in seconds (15–1800). Defaults to 60 seconds.
- Polls are created using the Twitch Helix API, so they appear as native Twitch polls.
- Only one poll can be active at a time.

## Examples

```
!poll create "Best game?" "Minecraft" "Fortnite" "Valorant" 120
!poll results
!poll end
```

## Dashboard Management

Polls can also be managed from the web dashboard at `/dashboard/polls`. The dashboard supports:

- Creating new polls with a form UI
- Viewing active poll results with progress bars
- Ending active polls
- Browsing poll history

## Requirements

The bot must have the **Manage Polls** scope on the broadcaster's Twitch account for poll commands to work.
