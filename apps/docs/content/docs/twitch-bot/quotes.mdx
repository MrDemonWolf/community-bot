The quote system lets you save memorable things said on stream. Quotes are stored per channel and shared across both Twitch and Discord.

## Twitch Commands

### Viewer Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `!quote` | Display a random quote |
| `!quote <number>` | Display a specific quote by number |
| `!quote search <text>` | Search quotes by keyword |

### Moderator Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `!quote add <text>` | Add a new quote (auto-records current game) |
| `!quote remove <number>` | Remove a quote by its number |

## Discord Commands

Quotes are also accessible from Discord via the `/quote` slash command:

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/quote` | Display a random quote (or by number) |
| `/quote add text:"quote text"` | Add a new quote |
| `/quote remove number:5` | Remove a quote by number |
| `/quote search text:"keyword"` | Search quotes by text |

## How It Works

- Each quote is assigned an auto-incrementing number per channel.
- The `source` field tracks whether a quote was added from Twitch or Discord.
- The current game/category is automatically recorded when adding a quote from Twitch.
- Quotes are managed per bot channel — the broadcaster's linked Twitch and Discord share the same quote pool.

## Dashboard Management

Quotes can also be managed from the web dashboard at `/dashboard/quotes`. The dashboard supports:

- Viewing all quotes with search and pagination
- Adding new quotes
- Removing quotes

## Public Page

Quotes are viewable on the public profile at `/p/quotes`. The page displays all quotes with their number, text, game tag, and who added them. The quotes link appears in the sidebar navigation when quotes exist.
