title: Response Variables
description: Placeholders you can use in database command responses.
---

Use these placeholders in the `response` field of database commands. They are replaced at runtime when the command executes.

## Basic Variables

| Variable | Replaced With | Example |
|----------|---------------|---------|
| `{user}` | Username of the person who triggered the command | `Hey {user}!` becomes `Hey coolviewer!` |
| `{channel}` | Channel name where the command was used | `Welcome to {channel}!` becomes `Welcome to mrdemonwolf!` |
| `{args}` | Everything the user typed after the command name | `!cmd hello world` makes `{args}` = `hello world` |

## Positional Arguments

| Variable | Replaced With | Example |
|----------|---------------|---------|
| `${1}`, `${2}`, etc. | Positional argument (1-indexed) | `!cmd foo bar` makes `${1}` = `foo`, `${2}` = `bar` |
| `${1\|fallback}` | Positional argument with a default | `${1\|@mrdemonwolf}` uses `@mrdemonwolf` if no arg given |

## Advanced Variables

| Variable | Replaced With | Example |
|----------|---------------|---------|
| `${random.pick '...' '...'}` | Random choice from a quoted list | `${random.pick 'hi' 'hello' 'hey'}` picks one at random |
| `${random.chatter}` | A random active user in the channel | `Shoutout to ${random.chatter}!` |
| `${time <timezone>}` | Current time in the given timezone | `${time America/Chicago}` becomes `3:45 PM` |

## Examples

**Simple greeting:**
```
Hey {user}, welcome to {channel}!
```
Output: `Hey coolviewer, welcome to mrdemonwolf!`

**Shoutout command:**
```
Go check out ${1|{user}} at https://twitch.tv/${1|{user}}
```
- `!so streamer123` outputs: `Go check out streamer123 at https://twitch.tv/streamer123`
- `!so` (no args) outputs: `Go check out coolviewer at https://twitch.tv/coolviewer`

**Random response:**
```
${random.pick 'PogChamp' 'LUL' 'Kappa' 'HeyGuys'}
```
Output: One of the emotes at random.
