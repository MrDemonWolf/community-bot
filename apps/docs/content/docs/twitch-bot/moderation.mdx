title: Moderation & Spam Filters
description: Configurable spam filters and moderation commands for Twitch chat.
---

The bot includes configurable spam filters that automatically moderate chat, plus several moderation commands for manual intervention.

## Spam Filters

Spam filters run on every chat message before command processing. Six filter types are available, each independently toggled:

| Filter | What It Checks | Key Settings |
|--------|---------------|--------------|
| **Caps** | Excessive uppercase characters | Min message length, max uppercase % |
| **Links** | URLs in messages | Option to allow subscribers |
| **Symbols** | Excessive symbols/special characters | Max symbol % |
| **Emotes** | Excessive emote usage | Max emote count |
| **Repetition** | Repeated characters or words | Max repeated count |
| **Banned Words** | Specific words or phrases | Custom word list |

### How It Works

1. Each message is checked against all enabled filters in order: banned words, links, caps, symbols, emotes, repetition.
2. Users at or above the configured **exempt level** bypass all filters (default: Subscriber).
3. Moderators and broadcasters are always exempt.
4. Users with an active **permit** (from `!permit`) bypass filters temporarily.
5. On violation, the user is timed out for the configured duration and a warning message is sent.

### Configuration

Spam filters are configured from the web dashboard at `/dashboard/moderation`. Global settings include:

| Setting | Description | Default |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| Exempt Level | Users at or above this level skip filters | Subscriber |
| Timeout Duration | Timeout length in seconds | 5 |
| Warning Message | Message sent to chat on violation | "Please don't spam." |

## Moderation Commands

### `!permit <username> [seconds]`

Temporarily allows a user to bypass spam filters. Useful for letting someone post a link or message that would normally be filtered.

- Default duration: 60 seconds
- Maximum duration: 3600 seconds (1 hour)
- Requires: Moderator or Broadcaster

### `!nuke <word/phrase> [seconds]`

Scans recent chat messages (last 100) and timeouts all users who sent messages containing the specified word or phrase.

- Default timeout: 300 seconds (5 minutes)
- The issuing moderator is excluded from timeout
- Requires: Moderator or Broadcaster

### `!vanish`

Clears your own messages from chat by self-applying a 1-second timeout. Available to everyone — a popular Fossabot-style command.

### `!clip`

Creates a Twitch clip of the current stream moment via the Helix API and returns the clip URL. Available to everyone.
