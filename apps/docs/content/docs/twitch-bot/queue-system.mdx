title: Queue System
description: Viewer queue for managing participation in the Twitch channel.
---

The queue system lets viewers sign up for activities (game lobbies, reviews, etc.) and lets moderators manage the queue from chat.

## Commands

### Moderator/Broadcaster Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `!queue open` | Open the queue for new entries |
| `!queue close` | Close the queue (no new joins) |
| `!queue next` | Pull the next viewer from the queue |
| `!queue clear` | Remove all entries from the queue |

### Viewer Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `!queue join` | Join the queue |
| `!queue leave` | Leave the queue |
| `!queue list` | Show current queue entries |
| `!queue position` | Check your position in the queue |

## How It Works

The queue is backed by the `QueueEntry` and `QueueState` database tables. Queue state (open/closed) persists across bot restarts.

When a viewer joins, they are added with a `WAITING` status. When `!queue next` is called, the first waiting entry is pulled and its status changes to `PICKED`. Viewers who leave or are cleared get a `REMOVED` status.

Viewers can also see the queue at the [public queue page](/docs/web-dashboard/public-pages).

## Queue Status Values

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `WAITING` | In queue, waiting to be picked |
| `PICKED` | Has been selected via `!queue next` |
| `REMOVED` | Left the queue or was cleared |
