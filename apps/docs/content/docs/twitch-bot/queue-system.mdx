title: Queue System
description: Viewer queue for managing participation in the Twitch channel.
---

The queue system lets viewers sign up for activities (game lobbies, reviews, etc.) and lets moderators manage the queue from chat.

## Commands

### Moderator/Broadcaster Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `!queue open` | Open the queue for new entries |
| `!queue close` | Close the queue (no new joins) |
| `!queue pause` | Pause the queue |
| `!queue unpause` | Unpause the queue (reopens it) |
| `!queue pick` | Pick the next viewer from the queue |
| `!queue pick random` | Pick a random viewer from the queue |
| `!queue pick <username>` | Pick a specific viewer by name |
| `!queue remove <username>` | Remove a specific viewer from the queue |
| `!queue clear` | Remove all entries from the queue |

### Viewer Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `!queue join` | Join the queue |
| `!queue leave` | Leave the queue |
| `!queue list` | Show current queue entries (up to 10) |
| `!queue position` | Check your position in the queue |

## How It Works

The queue is backed by the `QueueEntry` and `QueueState` database tables. Queue state (open/closed/paused) persists across bot restarts.

When a viewer joins, they are added with a `WAITING` status. When `!queue pick` is called, the next waiting entry is selected and its status changes to `PICKED`. Viewers who leave or are cleared get a `REMOVED` status.

Viewers can also see the queue at the [public queue page](/docs/web-dashboard/public-pages).

## Queue Status Values

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `WAITING` | In queue, waiting to be picked |
| `PICKED` | Has been selected via `!queue pick` |
| `REMOVED` | Left the queue or was cleared |
