title: Timers
description: Recurring chat messages that post at set intervals.
---

Timers are recurring messages that the bot automatically posts to chat at configurable intervals. Use them for reminders, social links, rules, or any repeated message.

## How It Works

- Each timer has a name, message, and interval (in minutes).
- Timers can optionally require a minimum number of chat messages between posts (`chatLines` threshold).
- Timers only fire when the channel is live (checked via the stream status manager).
- Timer messages support the same [response variables](/docs/twitch-bot/response-variables) as custom commands.
- Timers are loaded from the database on startup and reloaded via EventBus when updated from the dashboard.

## Configuration

Timers are managed exclusively from the web dashboard at `/dashboard/timers`. There are no chat commands for timer management.

### Timer Settings

| Setting | Description | Default |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| Name | Unique identifier for the timer | — |
| Message | The message to post (supports variables) | — |
| Interval | Minutes between posts | 5 |
| Chat Lines | Minimum chat messages required between posts (0 = ignore) | 0 |
| Enabled | Whether the timer is active | Yes |

## Dashboard Management

The dashboard at `/dashboard/timers` supports:

- Creating new timers with name, message, interval, and chat line threshold
- Editing existing timers
- Enabling/disabling individual timers
- Deleting timers

Changes are applied in real-time via the EventBus — no bot restart required.
