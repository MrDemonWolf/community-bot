title: Access Levels
description: Role hierarchy for Twitch bot command permissions.
---

Access levels follow a hierarchy — higher levels include all permissions of lower levels.

## Hierarchy

| Level | Rank | Who | Cooldown Bypass |
|-------|------|-----|-----------------|
| `EVERYONE` | 0 | All users | No |
| `SUBSCRIBER` | 1 | Subscribers and founders | No |
| `REGULAR` | 2 | Users in the `TwitchRegular` table | No |
| `VIP` | 3 | VIPs | No |
| `MODERATOR` | 4 | Moderators | Yes |
| `BROADCASTER` | 5 | The channel owner | Yes |

A command with `accessLevel: "VIP"` can be used by VIPs, moderators, and the broadcaster, but not by regulars, subscribers, or everyone.

## Managing Regulars

The `TwitchRegular` table defines users who get the REGULAR access level (rank 2, between SUBSCRIBER and VIP). Manage them via Prisma Studio:

```bash
pnpm db:studio
```

Each regular needs:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `twitchUserId` | The user's Twitch ID |
| `twitchUsername` | Display name (for reference) |
| `addedBy` | Who added them (for record keeping) |

## Cooldown Bypass

Moderators (rank 4) and broadcasters (rank 5) automatically bypass both global and user cooldowns on all commands.
