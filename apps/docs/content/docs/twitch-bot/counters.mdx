description: Named counters for tracking in-stream events like deaths, wins, and more.
---

Named counters let you track things like death counts, win streaks, or any other numeric value during a stream.

## Commands

All counter commands require moderator or broadcaster access.

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `!counter <name>` | Show the current value of a counter |
| `!counter <name> +` | Increment by 1 |
| `!counter <name> -` | Decrement by 1 |
| `!counter <name> set <value>` | Set to a specific value |
| `!counter <name> create` | Create a new counter (starts at 0) |
| `!counter <name> delete` | Delete a counter |

## Using Counters in Custom Commands

You can display a counter's value in any custom command response using the `{counter <name>}` variable:

```
Death count: {counter deaths}
```

This fetches the counter value from the database at runtime. If the counter doesn't exist, the placeholder is left as-is.

## Dashboard Management

Counters can also be managed from the web dashboard at `/dashboard/counters`. The dashboard supports:

- Viewing all counters with their current values
- Creating new counters
- Editing counter values
- Deleting counters
