- **Twitch Bot** — Chat bot built with Twurple for database-driven commands, viewer queues, and stream status tracking.
- **Web Dashboard** — Next.js app for managing bot settings, commands, and monitoring activity.
- **Shared Packages** — Prisma database client, validated environment variables, Redis event bus, shared TypeScript config, and a common Express server library.
