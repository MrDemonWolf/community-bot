title: Public Pages
description: Publicly accessible pages that don't require authentication.

Community Bot provides several public pages that viewers and community members can access without logging in.

## Available Pages

| Path | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `/p` | Public landing page for the broadcaster's channel |
| `/p/commands` | Lists all enabled Twitch chat commands with their triggers and descriptions |
| `/p/queue` | Shows the current viewer queue status and entries |

These pages read the broadcaster from the `SystemConfig` table (set during the [setup wizard](/docs/getting-started/setup-wizard)) and display data for their channel.

## Linking to Public Pages

You can link viewers to these pages from chat. If you set the `WEB_URL` environment variable in the Twitch bot, the built-in `!commands` command will automatically link to the commands page.

```bash
# In apps/twitch/.env
WEB_URL="https://bot.yourdomain.com"
```

The `!commands` response will then include a link to `https://bot.yourdomain.com/p/commands`.

## URL Redirects

Older URLs using `/public/*` are automatically redirected:

| Old URL | Redirects To |
|---------|-------------|
| `/public` | `/p` |
| `/public/commands` | `/p/commands` |
| `/public/queue` | `/p/queue` |
