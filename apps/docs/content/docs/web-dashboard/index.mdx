description: Overview of the Community Bot web dashboard.

The web dashboard is built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), [tRPC](https://trpc.io/), and [better-auth](https://www.better-auth.com/) for managing bot settings, commands, and monitoring activity.

## First-Time Setup

On first startup, the web app generates a one-time setup token and logs a URL to the console:

```
============================================================
  SETUP REQUIRED
  Visit: http://localhost:3001/setup/{token}
============================================================
```

Visit the URL to complete a multi-step wizard:

1. **Sign in** with Twitch (recommended) or Discord
2. **Authorize the bot** — log in with a separate Twitch account for the bot using Device Code Flow
3. **Link Twitch** account (if signed in via Discord)
4. **Enable the bot** for your Twitch channel
5. **Complete setup** — you are promoted to ADMIN and designated as the broadcaster

The setup token is single-use and deleted after completion. Subsequent startups skip this step.

## Authentication

Users sign in via Discord or Twitch OAuth through better-auth. Authentication is required for all dashboard pages. The dashboard is only accessible after the first-time setup has been completed.

## Dashboard Layout

The main dashboard (`/dashboard`) uses a two-column layout:

- **Left column** — Audit log feed showing recent mutations with user avatars, role badges, and relative timestamps
- **Right column** — Bot controls card (enable/disable, connection status) and quick stats (command count, regular count, stream status)

## Navigation

The dashboard sidebar organizes settings into sections:

### Twitch

- **Commands** — Create, edit, delete, and toggle custom chat commands; configure default command toggles and access levels
- **Regulars** — Manage trusted users who get elevated command access
- **Queue** — Viewer queue management

### Discord

- **Discord Settings** — Link a Discord server, configure notification channel and role, enable/disable notifications

### Account

- **Settings** — User profile and account settings

## Real-Time Updates

The dashboard publishes events via the Redis EventBus whenever settings are changed. The Twitch and Discord bots subscribe to these events and reload their configuration instantly without requiring a restart.
