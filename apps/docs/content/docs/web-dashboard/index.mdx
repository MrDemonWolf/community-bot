description: Overview of the Community Bot web dashboard.
---

The web dashboard is built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), [tRPC](https://trpc.io/), and [better-auth](https://www.better-auth.com/) for managing bot settings, commands, and monitoring activity.

Access at `http://localhost:3001/dashboard` in local development.

## First-Time Setup

On first startup, a setup wizard configures the broadcaster and bot account. See [First-Time Setup Wizard](/docs/getting-started/setup-wizard) for the full walkthrough.

## Authentication

Users sign in via Discord or Twitch OAuth through better-auth. Authentication is required for all dashboard pages. The dashboard is only accessible after the first-time setup has been completed.

## Role-Based Access

The dashboard uses role-based access. BROADCASTER (the channel owner) has full access to all settings. MODERATOR and LEAD_MODERATOR roles have access based on their level in the role hierarchy. See [Access Levels](/docs/twitch-bot/access-levels) for details on the role hierarchy.

## Dashboard Layout

The main dashboard (`/dashboard`) uses a two-column layout:

- **Left column** — Audit log feed showing recent mutations with user avatars, role badges, and relative timestamps
- **Right column** — Bot controls card (enable/disable, connection status) and quick stats (command count, regular count, stream status)

## Navigation

The dashboard sidebar organizes settings into sections:

### Twitch

- **Commands** — Create, edit, delete, and toggle custom chat commands; configure default command toggles and access levels
- **Regulars** — Manage trusted users who get elevated command access
- **Queue** — Viewer queue management from the dashboard (see [Queue Management](/docs/web-dashboard/queue-management))
- **Quotes** — View, add, and remove quotes (see [Quotes](/docs/twitch-bot/quotes))
- **Counters** — Create, edit, and delete named counters (see [Counters](/docs/twitch-bot/counters))
- **Timers** — Create, edit, and manage recurring chat timers (see [Timers](/docs/twitch-bot/timers))
- **Moderation** — Configure spam filters with per-filter toggles and settings (see [Moderation](/docs/twitch-bot/moderation))

### Discord

- **Discord Settings** — Link a Discord server, configure notification channel and role, enable/disable notifications
- **Welcome & Leave Messages** — Configure welcome messages, leave messages, auto-role, and DM welcomes (see [Welcome & Leave Messages](/docs/web-dashboard/welcome-messages))

### Management

- **Users** — User role management, ban/unban (BROADCASTER only). See [User Management](/docs/web-dashboard/user-management)

### Account

- **Settings** — User profile, feature toggles (AI shoutouts), and data export/import

## Public Pages

Several pages are accessible without authentication for viewers and community members. See [Public Pages](/docs/web-dashboard/public-pages) for details.

## Real-Time Updates

The dashboard publishes events via the Redis EventBus whenever settings are changed. The Twitch and Discord bots subscribe to these events and reload their configuration instantly without requiring a restart.
