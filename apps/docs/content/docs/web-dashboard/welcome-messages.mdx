## Feature Unavailable

Welcome messages, leave messages, auto-role, and DM welcome features are **not available** for verified Discord bots.

These features require the **GuildMembers** privileged Gateway intent, which Discord does not grant to verified bots without explicit approval. Without this intent, the `GuildMemberAdd` and `GuildMemberRemove` events do not fire reliably on large servers, making these features non-functional.

The database fields for these settings remain in the schema but are unused. No migration is needed.
