title: Queue Management
description: Managing the viewer queue from the web dashboard.
---

The queue management page (`/dashboard/queue`) provides a visual interface for managing the viewer queue alongside the [chat commands](/docs/twitch-bot/queue-system).

## Access

Queue management is available to users with **MODERATOR** or higher roles. The page displays the current queue status, entries, and provides controls for managing the queue.

### Role Guards

- **MODERATOR** and above can view the queue and its entries
- **MODERATOR** and above can pick, remove, and clear entries
- **BROADCASTER** and **LEAD_MODERATOR** can open, close, and pause the queue

## Status Controls

The queue has three states:

| Status | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **OPEN** | Viewers can join the queue via `!queue join` in chat |
| **CLOSED** | No new entries allowed; existing entries remain |
| **PAUSED** | Queue is temporarily frozen; no joins or picks |

Toggle between states using the status buttons at the top of the page.

## Queue Entry Management

### Pick

Select the next viewer from the queue. Options:

- **Pick next** — Selects the viewer with the lowest position number (first in line)
- **Pick random** — Selects a random viewer from the queue

When a viewer is picked, their entry is removed from the queue and a message is sent in Twitch chat.

### Remove

Remove a specific viewer from the queue by clicking the remove button next to their entry.

### Clear

Remove all entries from the queue at once. This action requires confirmation.

## Real-Time Sync

The dashboard and Twitch chat bot stay in sync via the EventBus:

- When a viewer joins or leaves via chat, the dashboard updates automatically
- When a moderator picks or removes from the dashboard, the Twitch bot is notified
- Both publish `queue:updated` events with the channel ID

This means you can manage the queue from chat and the dashboard simultaneously without conflicts.

## Audit Logging

All queue management actions from the dashboard are recorded in the audit log:

| Action | When |
|--------|------|
| `queue.open` | Queue is opened |
| `queue.close` | Queue is closed |
| `queue.pause` | Queue is paused |
| `queue.pick` | A viewer is picked (next or random) |
| `queue.remove-entry` | A viewer is removed from the queue |
| `queue.clear` | All entries are cleared |
