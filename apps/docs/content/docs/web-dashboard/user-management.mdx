title: User Management
description: Managing user roles and bans from the web dashboard.
---

The user management page (`/dashboard/users`) is a BROADCASTER-only page for managing all users who have signed in to the dashboard.

## Access

Only users with the **BROADCASTER** role can access the user management page. Other roles will not see it in the sidebar navigation.

## Features

### Role Management

Change a user's role from the user list. Available roles in the hierarchy:

| Role | Level | Description |
|------|-------|-------------|
| **USER** | 1 | Default role for all users |
| **MODERATOR** | 2 | Can manage commands and regulars |
| **LEAD_MODERATOR** | 3 | Extended moderation access |
| **BROADCASTER** | 4 | Full access to all settings (owner) |

Role changes take effect immediately. The user's dashboard access is updated on their next page load.

### Ban / Unban

Ban a user to revoke their dashboard access entirely. Banned users cannot sign in or access any dashboard pages. Unban a user to restore their access.

### Search and Filter

- **Search** — Filter users by name or email
- **Role filter** — Show only users with a specific role
- **Status filter** — Show active or banned users

## Auto-Link Twitch from Discord

When a user signs in via Discord, the system automatically checks if their Discord account is linked to a Twitch account and creates the association. This means users who sign in with Discord get their Twitch identity linked without extra steps.

## Audit Logging

All user management actions are recorded in the audit log:

| Action | When |
|--------|------|
| `user.role-change` | A user's role is changed |
| `user.ban` | A user is banned |
| `user.unban` | A user is unbanned |
