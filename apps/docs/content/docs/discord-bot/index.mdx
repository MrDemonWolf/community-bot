The Discord bot is built with [discord.js](https://discord.js.org/) v14 and provides Twitch live stream notifications and server management via slash commands.

## Features

- **Twitch stream notifications** — Monitors configured Twitch channels and posts embed notifications when they go live
- **Slash commands** — Full slash command interface for managing Twitch channel subscriptions and cross-platform quotes
- **Background jobs** — BullMQ-powered job queue for periodic tasks (activity rotation, stream checking)
- **Guild sync** — Automatically syncs guild data to the database on join/leave
- **Dashboard-controlled settings** — Notification channel, role, and enable/disable can be managed from the web dashboard
- **EventBus integration** — Subscribes to `discord:settings-updated` events to reload guild settings in real time

To set up your Discord application, see [Create a Discord Application](/docs/getting-started/create-discord-app).

## Architecture

The bot runs as a single Node.js process with:

1. **Discord.js client** — Connects to Discord Gateway with guild intents
2. **BullMQ worker** — Processes background jobs (activity updates every 15min, stream checks every 90s)
3. **Express API** — HTTP server on port 3141 (configurable) with [comprehensive health check](/docs/development/health-checks) endpoint
4. **Redis** — Used by BullMQ for job queue persistence
5. **PostgreSQL** — Stores guild settings and Twitch notification configs via Prisma
