description: Discord slash commands for managing Twitch notifications.
---

All commands are under the `/twitch` command group. All `/twitch` commands require the configured **Admin Role** or the **Manage Server** Discord permission.

**Prerequisites:** A notification channel must be set with `/twitch notifications set-channel` before live notifications will work.

## `/twitch add <username>`

Add a Twitch channel to monitor for live stream notifications. Validates the username against the Twitch API and stores the channel in the database.

**Parameters:**
- `username` (required) — The Twitch channel username to monitor

## `/twitch remove <username>`

Remove a Twitch channel from the notification list. Also removes all associated notification records.

**Parameters:**
- `username` (required) — The Twitch channel username to stop monitoring

## `/twitch list`

List all Twitch channels currently being monitored in this guild. Shows an embed with the current notification channel, notification role, and all monitored channels with live/offline status indicators.

## `/twitch test <username>`

Send a test notification for a Twitch channel to verify the setup is working correctly. Sends a simulated live notification embed to the configured channel with a fake viewer count. After 10 seconds, the embed is edited to show an offline state. Useful for verifying your notification channel and role configuration.

**Restricted to the bot owner only** (the `OWNER_ID` configured in environment variables).

**Parameters:**
- `username` (required) — The Twitch channel to send a test notification for

## `/twitch notifications set-channel <channel>`

Set the Discord channel where Twitch live notifications will be posted. Only text channels are accepted.

**Parameters:**
- `channel` (required) — The Discord text channel to receive notifications

## `/twitch notifications set-role <role>`

Set a role to ping when a Twitch stream goes live.

**Parameters:**
- `role` (required) — The Discord role to mention in notifications

## `/quote` Commands

The `/quote` command group provides cross-platform quote management, shared with the Twitch bot. The `/quote add` and `/quote remove` subcommands require the configured **Mod Role** or the **Manage Messages** Discord permission.

### `/quote show [number]`

Show a random quote, or a specific quote by number.

**Parameters:**
- `number` (optional) — The quote number to display. Omit for a random quote.

### `/quote add <text>`

Add a new quote to the shared quote database.

**Parameters:**
- `text` (required) — The quote text to add

### `/quote remove <number>`

Remove a quote by its number.

**Parameters:**
- `number` (required) — The quote number to remove

### `/quote search <text>`

Search quotes by keyword.

**Parameters:**
- `text` (required) — The text to search for in quotes

## Configurable Role Mapping

By default, `/twitch` commands require the **Manage Server** Discord permission and `/quote add`/`remove` require **Manage Messages**. You can override this by configuring role mappings in the web dashboard under **Discord Settings > Role Mapping**:

- **Admin Role** — Members with this role can use `/twitch` commands (falls back to Manage Server)
- **Mod Role** — Members with this role can use `/quote add` and `/quote remove` (falls back to Manage Messages). Members with the Admin Role also have mod permissions.

When a role mapping is configured, users with that role can use the corresponding commands even without the default Discord permission. If no role is configured, the bot falls back to checking the standard Discord permission.
