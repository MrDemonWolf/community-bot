All commands are under the `/twitch` command group. All `/twitch` commands require the **Manage Server** Discord permission.

**Prerequisites:** A notification channel must be set with `/twitch notifications set-channel` before live notifications will work.

## `/twitch add <username>`

Add a Twitch channel to monitor for live stream notifications. Validates the username against the Twitch API and stores the channel in the database.

**Parameters:**
- `username` (required) — The Twitch channel username to monitor

## `/twitch remove <username>`

Remove a Twitch channel from the notification list. Also removes all associated notification records.

**Parameters:**
- `username` (required) — The Twitch channel username to stop monitoring

## `/twitch list`

List all Twitch channels currently being monitored in this guild. Shows an embed with the current notification channel, notification role, and all monitored channels with live/offline status indicators.

## `/twitch test <username>`
